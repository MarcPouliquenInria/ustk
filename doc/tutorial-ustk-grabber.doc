\section intro_ustk_grabber Introduction

This tutorial expains how to grab ultrasound images using a TCP connection between the ultrasound station and a client, and to remote-control the station to change acquisition parameters.

The source code used is available in ustk repository, in the tutorial folder.


\section ustk_grabber_basic Simple grabbing

The easiest way to grab images using the ustk grabber is to let the acquisition parameters to default. Here is the code to simply grab pre-scan images : 

\include tutorial-ultrasonix-qt-grabbing-pre-scan.cpp

Some details about this code :

- You will need Qt to use the grabber (it is based on QTcpSocket)
- You will need X11 to display the images
- This code sets some parameters :
  - Probe id : the id of the ultrasound probe you mant to use. Here we selected the 4DC7(15).
  - Slot id : there is 3 slots on the station to connect probes. The top one has the id 0, the middle one 2, and the bottom ont 1.
  - Imaging mode : we selected B-mode (pre-scan) images using the id 0.

Note that the acquire() method can be blocking, to prevent grabbing 2 times the same frame (if you call it faster than the frames are arriving). But if you call it slower, you will loose frames.

\section ustk_grabber_change_params Grabbing with selection of acquisition parameters

If you want to remotely change the acquisition parameters, here is a code showing how to proceed :

\include tutorial-ultrasonix-qt-grabbing-post-scan.cpp

Some details about this code :

- To change a parameter from its default value, you have to use first the setters of the usNetworkGrabber class. This will update the parameters locally.
- Once you're done with setting the new parameters, you have to send them to the ultrasound machine using usNetworkGrabber::sendAcquisitionParameters()
- And finally you can run the acquisition using usNetworkGrabber::runAcquisition(), you are then going to receive the images.
